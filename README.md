<h1>AO3 Skin Cherry Pink Star</h1>
This skin needs input in the wizard location as well. There still issues but it is functionally which I am working on it. 

Built from two other codes from:
<a href="https://github.com/ZerafinaCSS/Replace-the-AO3-Icons-2.0/tree/main">ZerafinaCSS for Icons changes to AO3</a> 
and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/collections/Ao3skin/works/54000925">Cuephrase for Icons changes to stats</a> 

Here are the inputs for Wizard.
